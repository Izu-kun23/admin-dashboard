# Public Folder

This folder contains static assets for your Next.js application.

## Common files you might add here:

- `favicon.ico` - Website favicon
- `logo.png` - Company/application logo
- `robots.txt` - Search engine crawler instructions
- `sitemap.xml` - Website sitemap
- `manifest.json` - PWA manifest file
- Images, icons, and other static assets

## Usage in your app:

You can reference files in the public folder using absolute paths:

```jsx
<img src="/logo.png" alt="Logo" />
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
```

The public folder is served from the root URL (`/`) of your application.
